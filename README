Example of spells:
- spell for rank for player sam:
	rank
	00000000:q:sam:Lightning:9223372040358808912

- spell to attack:
	attack
	0000:q:cast_speed:Fire:107810
	0000:q:speed:Fire:76391
	0000:q:power:Fire:76289
	0000:q:range:Fire:85784

It is possible to lower the strength by removing some zeros like:
	0:q:cast_speed:Fire:107810

The spell is valid if the hash begins with the desired number of zeros
	core.sha1('qspeedFire76391') == 0000db7078e166d6f700c5ca835ef6771249325e

The player has to find a nonce to have a working spell.
